## Setting Up Auto-Moderation and Raid Protection

Protect your server by enabling anti-raid and moderation tools. Use slash commands or prefix-based commands like `,antiraid`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Mass Join Protection" icon="lock">
    Configure raid protection for sudden member spikes.

````bash
,antiraid massjoin on --threshold 5 --do kick --lock true --punish true
````

    This sets a threshold of `>5` joins in a short time, kicks raiders, locks channels, and punishes new members.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Auto-Moderation" icon="shield">
    Enable filters for spam and bad words.

````bash
,automod on --spam true --links false --wordfilter true
````
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Configuration" icon="check-circle">
    Simulate a raid or spam to verify settings work as expected.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="alert">
Always test moderation in a private channel to avoid false positives on legitimate users.

## Configuring the Level System and Rewards

The leveling system tracks user activity like messages and reactions, assigning XP and roles at milestones.
